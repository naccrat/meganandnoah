							<h2>Our Story <i class="fa-light fa-book"></i></h2>
							<p>How we met. The first date</p>
						</header>
						<p>Our friends met on Mutual and wanted to go on a date. They made it a group date and asked us both to come. We first met on September 12, 2020. The date was a scavenger hunt at City Creek. We had a list of stores we had to go to and specific things we needed to take pictures of. The first place we went was the Disney store and the first picture we ever took together was with a baby yoda mug <i class="fa-light fa-sword-laser-alt"></i>. We ended the date by eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Noah said it was the most expensive first date he had ever been on.</p>

							<p>The second date</p>
						</header>
						<p>The second time we were together was a little hangout with our friends. We went on a hike and got Panda Express afterwards. Everyone was reading their fortunes and these were ours, <strong>no joke</strong>:</p>
						<p>Megan's:</p>
						<blockquote>‚ÄúA new relationship awaits.‚Äù</blockquote>
						<p>Noah's:</p>
						<blockquote>‚ÄúYou know what you want, now go and get it.‚Äù</blockquote>
						<p>So the next date was just us, Nielson's Frozen Custard, and The Three Amigos. Since Noah was from Maine and had come to BYU for school, he didn't have a car yet. That night he missed the train so I drove him back to his apartment in Provo. That was the first of many long drives to and from Provo.</p>

						<p>November 14, 2020 We went on a day trip to Zions National Park.</p>
						<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0960_Original.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
						<p>December 2020 We had been dating for less than 2 months when I visited Noah and his family in Maine. We visited the ocean, took a walk in the woods, made his family‚Äôs traditional Christmas food, and fell in love.</p>

						<p>May 23, 2021 I gave my farewell talk and would start my mission in the Washington Yakima mission on May 26. We both knew I needed to serve a mission but we also both knew we loved each other and wanted a future together. We wrote each other every week for 567 days (but who was counting).

						After a long year and a half, we were reunited on December 13, 2022.
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/farewell2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						Just some fun times since I‚Äôve been home. New Years at the cabin and visiting the Ogden Temple and deciding that‚Äôs where we wanted to be sealed.
